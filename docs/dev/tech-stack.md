# Technology Stack

To provide a solid platform and allow collaboration of a broad community, we make use of some of the best-known, best-tested and best supported technologies:

* [*Raspberry Pi*](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) as hardware
* [*Hypriot*](https://blog.hypriot.com/) as operating system
* [*Docker*](https://www.docker.com/) and [*Docker Swarm*](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) for easy installation, updates and removal of software components and applications
* Mainly [*NodeJS*](https://nodejs.org/) for building applications (but in theory, any other programming language, platform or framework could be used), since it is prevalent, based on a common language and probably the platform with the most public contributions and the biggest set of modules and plugins available
