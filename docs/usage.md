## Usage

Keeping private data private should be easy, this means taking a _Home Sweet Host_ to operation should be a breeze.
I.e. users should only be required to:

* Plug it into a router and a power outlet
* After the first start, configure it from the home network through the webbrowser or the official app:
  * Create an administrator password
  * Optional steps (can also be done later at any time):
    * Only if it should be accessible from outside the home network: set up a *HomeConnect* ID (normal users) or a custom DNS registration (advanced users)
    * Set up a startup key (small USB drive with an encryption algorithm on it), to ensure that only the owners can start the _Home Sweet Host_
    * Create users with passwords and privileges

After that, the _Home Sweet Host_ is ready to be used! Here is how:

Each _Home Sweet Host_ application contains two parts:
* A *client* or *frontend*, such as a smart phone or a webbrowser
* A *server component* or *backend*, that _Home Sweet Host_ installs on itself

The server components can be installed via an Administration mobile app or the webbrowser from a central store, just like mobile app stores.
The client parts for smart phones will be available as normal mobile apps in the according app stores for *Android* and *Apple*. They need to be set up to connect to a specific _Home Sweet Host_ with a user-password combination.
