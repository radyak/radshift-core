# The ***Home Sweet Host*** *Project* 

Welcome to the Project site of ***Home Sweet Host***!

Take a seat, have a look and feel yourself at home!

## What is the ***Home Sweet Host*** *Project*?

*Home Sweet Host* is a mini home server for anyone, which ...
* ... is easy to set up and use,
* ... can be accessed only you (and trusted persons) and
* ... keeps your data private and close to you - no need to trust big companies and hand them over your privacy!

## How does it work?

Every mobile or web app, e.g. for

* contacts
* calendars
* health data
* private files
* and nearly any other data you could think of

requires a *backend* that is usually hosted remotely by big companies. This makes it intransparent what happens to the user's data and how it is used by the companies.
That's where *Home Sweet Host* kicks in: *Home Sweet Host* aims to provide each and every private person with the maxmium of reliable privacy for their data.

To achieve this, we believe that hosting your own microscopic home server, that only you (and trusted persons) can access, is the best solution. And this should be as easy and at the same time as secure as possible. Like "Plug it, set up a password and go". Have your app backends at home where it is secure from unauthorized access!


For a detailed information on what we aim for, have a look at the project's [Goals](./docs/goals.md).



## Current state

The project was started in Jan' 2019 and is currently still in 

> <big>***prototype state***</big>

For more information on what we have already achieved, have a look at the project's [Status](./docs/status.md).


## But why do we think we need a project like this?

In these times of Facebook, Google and other data collectors we all use apps with great convenience for free. Wait... actually for ***free***?

> ***No.*** How should it even be free?

> Ever wondered how those big companies earn billions and billions of dollars? They earn from us. We always pay to them. We don't necessarily pay with money. But with our data, with our personal information, with our privacy.

But then, why does everybody use apps that expose all of our data?

> Because it is sooo convenient. You install an app on your mobile phone, maybe register and you're ready to go.

Exactly! It is so easy.. Well ok, they use some of my data. But it is only used by them. No need to be paranoid. So what?

> Uhm, you've read about all the data leaks and how the user's data was sold by big companies recently, right? Some of them were even used to influence elections.

Well... yes... there were some rumors. I know. But on the other hand, I have nothing to hide. Why should I care?

> Well, yes. That's a point. Uhm ok... you might... aswell go ahead and leave everything exposed to everybody, like all your personal information, your and your friend's contact data, your installed apps and how you use them, your geo position, maybe messages to friends & family, notes, images & videos, diaries or what not.

Mh... yeah that's what way saying...

> Yes. I mean, what could go wrong, right? At least as long as you don't live in countries that are interested in your data, like North Corea, or China, or Cuba...

> Actually, there's a great quote I've read yesterday:
> 
>> <big>*"Times have changed so little during the last decades, we always know what comes next. Our country is stable and the time of big changes is far gone. We are so safe here."*</big>
>> 
>> *The people of Turkey, Belarus, Venezuela, Honduras, USA, Philippines, Russia, Hungary. Others yet to follow.*

Uhm..

> ***Now care to keep your data as close to you as possible?***

Just as I thought.
